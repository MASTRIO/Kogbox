# Kogbox
 A game made in Rust where you code what you want the game to do, I'll explain it better when I can be bothered (and when I've actually properly implemented it).
 
 Fun fact: Origionaly this game was going to be a python package that I coded in rust, now it's even more poggers because you code in a 'custom programming language' that I made
